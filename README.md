# CPS510-Hotel-Database-Management-System
Hotel DBMS Project developed over the course of ten labs (A1 - A10)

UNIX Shell Implementation
Bash Scripts designed for simple UNIX Shell Implementation of the Hotel DBMS. The main script file is 'menu.sh' to execute the implementation, and it provides users the ability to create, drop, and populate tables in our Hotel DBMS. Additionally can view results of 5 advanced queries created using join and set operations, aggregate functions, and grouping queries. 

Java Implementation
A version of the UNIX implementation designed through Java (implementation runs through the terminal). It provides users to view and execute the exact same cases as the UNIX Shell implementation. The main file is HotelApp.java to execute and try the implementation. 

In order to connect the database, you would need my TMU credentails, but anyone can use their own database. You can design a database to fit my code or edit my code based on your database. 

Plans to Update: Create a JAVA GUI version of this Hotel DBMS.
